Assignment instructure list in `Assignment2_Instructions.pdf`

- required to conduct some preliminary analysis on the data.
- mandatory requirement: **principal component analysis (PCA)**
- optional: cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling
- Report no more than 1500 words

Guidance:
- Is the data clean? Are there missing values, outliers or other data credibility issues?
- Can you derive any insights from the data from simple exploratory analysis including summary statistics and basic plots?
- Can the data be easily visualised?
- How can you profile the principal components? Do they have some interpretation in terms of the data itself?
- Does the report contain enough information to be reproduced by somebody with knowledge of the techniques used?
- Are all plots clearly presented and correctly explained?
- Is the analysis robust to minor changes in the methodology?
- Are any assumptions made for the analysis or in drawing conclusions. If so, are these clearly explained?
- Does the report focus on a small number of interesting features of the analysis or does the report simply list everything that was attempted (the former is preferable to the latter)?
- Are the limitations of the analysis clearly discussed?
